<h2 id="about">What is the Crash Stack?</h2>

The _"Crash Stack"_ is a web development stack focused on **simplicity** and a **clean developer experience**. It consists of:

- [A custom ESLint config (based on Airbnb's config) - for tightened up code.](https://github.com/iamturns/eslint-config-airbnb-typescript)
- [A ready-to-use folder structure (based on React's recommendations) - for clean file organization.](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html)
- [Husky - for improved Git commits.](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app)
- [Next.js - for a solid React.js framework.](https://nextjs.org)
- [Firebase - for a simple BaaS.](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [TypeScript - for typesafety.](https://typescriptlang.org)

There's definitely a good bunch of us who love TypeScript, Next.js, and the Firebase suite. But of course, you don't need these technologies for every project.

To be frank - this is an _opinionated project_. After working on several projects, I've got a handful of core beliefs around building React.js apps.

I made `create-crash-app` to do one thing: **_Simplify the process of spinning up a TypeScript/Next.js/Firebase app with a strict config_**. This is NOT an all-inclusive template and you should definetly add your own libraries if need be.

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

To get started with `create-crash-app`, click the **_Use this template_** button at the top of the page. Once you've cloned the repo locally, run the following command:

```bash
npm i
```
